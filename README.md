# A dynamic volunteer's dilemma.

This is a dynamic version of volunteer's dilemma (Diekmann 1985).

_N_ players have to take a decision who will pay a price.

As soon as a single player volunteers to pay the price, everyone in a group receives a certain amount.

The one who agreed to pay, receives this amount minus the price.

The price grows every second. As soon as it reaches the endowment, the game ends, and everyone gets 0.
